#This system works with PHP and a Mysql Database using a MVC framework, the config.php file stores the necessary 
#to connect to the database, and it has been anonymised so you can put your details:

#	const DB_USER_CPANEL = "xxxxxx"; Username or a user with access to the database
#	const DB_PASS_CPANEL = "xxxxxx"; Password for the user that you have specified

#Controller.php is the file that controls the input from the user
#View.php is the file that creates the different interfaces of this application.

#The structure of the table used in the database is:
#id INT(11)
#id_course VARCHAR(10)
#id_sga1 INT(11)
